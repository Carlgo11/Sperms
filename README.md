Super Permission Execution and Restriction Management System (SPERMS)
======

The people that make SPERMS:
Carlgo11: lead-developer
AeSix : lead-developer

SPERMS is a permission plugin much better then Groupmanager and PEX. SPERMS doesn't only manage permission,
it also make small (child) programms that run small servers that will take all of your ram memory and crash the host-computer!
